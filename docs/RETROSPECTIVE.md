# Retrospective 3

One aspect of the project that has not been as successful as we would have liked is completing the
appropriate documentation and the worksheet before the day that it is due. In the past 2 iterations,
we did not review the worksheet and non-coding related tasks until the day before the deadline
resulting in added pressure and fewer opportunities to ask clarifying questions. 
The second aspect we identified was remembering to keep track of the actual time spent completing 
tasks. This is a habit we were not accustomed to doing when writing code and we overestimated our 
ability to remember what time we started at once we were done with the work. As a result, creating
estimates was difficult since we didn't have accurate data from the first iteration and we also 
needed to compensate with the changes in the workload from iteration 1 to iteration 2.

To improve on these two weaknesses of ours, in iteration 3 we will review the rubric and worksheet
together as a group before assigning tasks and setting the expectation as a group that we will 
write down the starting time for when we both begin and end a coding session. At our mid iteration 
meeting we will also discuss and answer any of the questions in the worksheet that can be completed
at that time.

How our changes will be determined to be a success if we have accurate times to report for how long
it takes to complete a task. The worksheet and documentation need to be continually being worked on 
throughout the iteration as well as completed at a predetermined time of 23, April, 2022 which is 2 
days before the deadline.
