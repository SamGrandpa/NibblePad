# Vision Statement

NibblePad is a food experience diary application that will be used to store, view, and share a user's experiences with restaurants and foods.

## What is this app?

Eating new foods can be intimidating, especially when it comes to trying new cuisines at an unfamiliar restaurant. By documenting and sharing their restaurant experiences and meals, with people in their social network and beyond, NibblePad will inspire users to leave their comfort zone and seek novel culinary encounters. Our app functions as a convenient space where the user will document the various restaurants and foods they have tried. To encourage users to regularly engage with the app, NibblePad features a point-based system that rewards users through their continued use of the app. By gamifying the restaurant and eating experience, NibblePad aims to encourage users to have fresh experiences by trying new restaurants and cuisines. The point system will motivate users to seek out new gastronomic experiences and share them with their friends.

## Who is this app for?

NibblePad is designed for individuals looking to keep track of the restaurants they have visited and the meals they eat. However, anyone interested in seeking novel experiences — specifically trying new foods and restaurants — will enjoy the app. The specific target audience are those who have hobbies and interests pertaining to food and cuisine and ideally, may have a social media presence, which includes self-proclaimed “foodies“, restaurant reviewers, food critics, and social media influencers, as they are more likely to share their food diary with others. This app may also be useful for tourists when they find themselves in a foreign destination and unfamiliar with the food locales.

## Why is this app valuable?

People often overestimate their ability to remember things; in addition to recording restaurants and meals, this app provides a space for them to take notes on their experiences for future reference. We also believe many people are hesitant to try new cuisines and typically visit only a small handful of restaurants because familiarity is comforting. Through consistent use of the app, the user may be encouraged to try new cuisines and restaurants.This app promotes restaurant diversity by incentivising users to try new experiences, and sharing the food the eat is one of the best ways to do that. When users see the scores of other users as they share their diary, it will incentivise them to continue discovering new restaurants and eat unique meals as a result.

## Success Criteria

For this app to be considered a success, users should be visiting new restaurants and exploring new cuisine more frequently. It should be more efficient for users to write in their digital diary than a more traditional paperback notebook. In order to measure the success of our project, we will track how often the user tries a new restaurant or food through a point-based system. It will be considered a success If the user tries something new at least once a week. We will also consider the project to be a success if our community of users share their diary with another at least once a month.
