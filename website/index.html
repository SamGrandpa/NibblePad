								<h2><strong>Our Vision</strong></h2>
							</header>
							<p>NibblePad is a food experience diary application that will be used to store, view, and share a user's experiences with restaurants and foods.</p>
							
							<header class="major">
								<h2><strong>Target Audience</strong></h2>
							</header>
							<p>NibblePad is designed for individuals looking to keep track of the restaurants they have visited and the meals they eat.
							However, anyone interested in seeking novel experiences — specifically trying new foods and restaurants — will enjoy the app. 
							</p>
							<p>The specific target audience are those who have hobbies and interests pertaining to food and cuisine and ideally, may have a social media presence, 
							which includes self-proclaimed “foodies“, restaurant reviewers, food critics, and social media influencers, as they are more likely to share their food diary with others. 
							</p>
							<p>
							This app may also be useful for tourists when they find themselves in a foreign destination and unfamiliar with the food locales.

							<h3>Kabir Bhakta</h3>
							<p>"The process of developing NibblePad has taught me many new things. 
							Before this I haven't worked on any app like this and have never worked with a team, this project helped me gain valuable knowledge a
							bout how you collaborate with a team and work on the same project. It also taught me how the small pieces of an app development are 
							connected together using various software development techniques."</p>

							<h3>Mohsen Yousefian</h3>
							<p>"Through the development process, I gained further understanding of important testing techniques and tricks like mocking and the 
							power of automated and integrated tests. I also learned more about the Android API specifically. And how to make our project more 
							manageable by following good programming practices and software architecture for an easily scalable app."</p>

							<h3>Piers Grenier</h3>
							<p>In the process of developing NibblePad I became more accustomed to an Agile environment and app development in general. 
							I learned how to build features based on user stories and evaluate them using Android Studio as a primary tool. 
							I gained insight on different branching strategies and how to interpret architecture diagrams using our project. 
							Finally, the importance of technical debt was instilled for me and strategies to minimize it were revealed.</p>

							<h3>Yengin Loay</h3>
							<p>Building NibblePad allowed me to explore Android development for the first time. 
							I gained familiarity with the Android documentation which is an incredible resource for learning. 
							Becoming more comfortable with Android Studio was an important skill to work more efficiently in particular, using the testing tools and debugger.</p>

							<h3>Zhangyu Qing</h3>
							<p>By developing NibblePad, I learned many things in the field of software engineering like how and when to apply design patterns and different types of test doubles. 
							I am also getting more familiar with android studio and operations in gitlab like how to do right push and pull from remote to local, 
							and how to solve conflicts when code of different programmers are merged into the dev branch.</p>

						<h2>Area identified for improvement after iteration 2:</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After Iteration 2, areas identified that we could improve upon were proper documentation, and reviewing the worksheet, and taking the time and effort needed to complete them into consideration when planning for the next iteration. 
					We make time estimates for features, user stories, and developer tasks but there is additional work to be done in addition to writing code which we did not put enough of an emphasis or importance on. 
					For the final iteration, we assigned specific parts of the worksheet and presentation to team members ensuring that it doesn’t become an afterthought.</p>
					
					<header class="minor">
						<h2>What went right in the development process?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Maintaining regular communication through Discord about the project with all group members and was a large contributor to the success of the project. 
					We clearly identified the tasks that needed to be done for each iteration and who would be completing them. 
					Communicating early when running into blockers allowed other team members a chance to look and get new ideas on how to get past them resulting in the technical aspects to be successful.</p>
					
					<header class="minor">
						<h2>What went wrong in the development process?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Most of our attention was focused on the technical aspect of building the app. 
					Completing features, writing high quality code, and useful tests while extremely important, other requirements for the project were neglected. 
					Proper documentation of our work, reviewing the requirements and worksheet for each iteration wasn’t given enough of a priority. 
					Despite identifying this as an issue after Iteration 1, we repeated this mistake again in Iteration 2.</p>

						<p>Our estimates became worse from iteration 1 to iteration 2 but improved from iteration 2 to iteration 3. 
						We already had experience with many of the tasks such as writing Java classes for objects and unit tests so those were either accurate or took less than the estimated time. 
						However, the tasks that were new to us, specifically working on the UI components required additional time. </p>
						<p>For Iteration 2, we expected it to be more technically challenging and have an increased workload because there were more project requirements than than the first iteration. 
						To adjust for these factors, we were more generous with our time estimates. This resulted in an overestimation because we were overly cautious. Many of the tasks ended up taking the expected amount of time or less. 
						At the end of iteration 2 we realised that we were increasing the time estimate to account for the additional work required that was not code related such as the worksheet, updating the architecture diagram and finding SOLID violations and. 
						Separate issues should either have been created with their own time estimates or not factored into the estimates at all.</p>
						<p>Iteration 3 had the most accurate time estimations which isn't surprising. We gained more insight over the past 4 months into how long tasks would take due to our increased familiarity with Android development, 
						a better understanding of all the non-coding related tasks. Our awareness of the overall time each of us had available to commit that we have to the project was also a strong contributing factor in the project velocity for Iteration 3.</p>
